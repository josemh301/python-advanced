    "# 14_Abstract classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract classes in Python are a way to define a class that cannot be instantiated on its own, but instead serves as a blueprint for other classes. These classes are defined using the `ABC` (Abstract Base Class) module from the Python standard library. Abstract classes are particularly useful when you have a set of methods that you want to ensure are implemented in any subclass derived from the abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of abstract classes in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cannot be instantiated**: Abstract classes cannot be used to create objects directly. They are designed to be subclassed, and their abstract methods must be implemented in the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstract methods**: These are methods declared in the abstract class with the `@abstractmethod` decorator, and they have no implementation in the abstract class itself. Subclasses are required to provide an implementation for these methods. If a subclass does not implement all the abstract methods, it too becomes an abstract class and cannot be instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use of `abc` module**: To create an abstract class, you typically inherit from `ABC` class from the `abc` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example to illustrate an abstract class in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class AbstractShape(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def perimeter(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Rectangle(AbstractShape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def perimeter(self):\n",
    "        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)\n",
    "\n",
    "# shape = AbstractShape()  # This will raise an error, as AbstractShape cannot be instantiated\n",
    "rectangle = Rectangle(3, 4)\n",
    "print(rectangle.area())  # Outputs: 12\n",
    "print(rectangle.perimeter())  # Outputs: 14\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `AbstractShape` is an abstract class with abstract methods `area` and `perimeter`. The `Rectangle` class inherits from `AbstractShape` and provides specific implementations for these methods. The abstract class ensures that each subclass has its own implementations of `area` and `perimeter`."

    "The term \"MRO\" stands for Method Resolution Order. It's a concept used in object-oriented programming to establish the order in which methods should be inherited in the presence of multiple inheritance, i.e., when a class is derived from more than one base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a specific algorithm called C3 Linearization to determine the MRO. This algorithm provides a consistent and predictable order to resolve method calls, especially when a method is overridden in multiple base classes. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Subclasses precede their base classes**: In the MRO, a class always appears before its base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Base class order is preserved**: The order of base classes as specified in the class definition is preserved in the MRO.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **First two rules are applied recursively**: To construct the MRO of a class, Python starts with the class itself and then applies these rules recursively to include the base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view the MRO of a class in Python by using the `.__mro__` attribute or the `mro()` method on the class. Hereâ€™s a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class B(A):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class C(A):\n",
    "    pass\n",

    "class D(B, C):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the __mro__ attribute\n",
    "print(D.__mro__)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the mro() method\n",
    "print(D.mro())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output the MRO for class `D`, showing the order in which Python will look for methods if they are called on an instance of `D`."
