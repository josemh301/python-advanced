    "# 44_02 Variable scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable scope refers to the region in a program where a variable is accessible. Variable scope determines where you can access a variable and how long it exists. Understanding variable scope is crucial for avoiding bugs and writing efficient, maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are mainly four types of variable scopes in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Local Scope**: Variables created within a function belong to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enclosing Scope**: This is relevant for nested functions. If a variable is not found in the local scope, Python looks for it in the enclosing scope, i.e., the scope of the outer or enclosing function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Global Scope**: Variables defined at the top level of a module or explicitly declared global using the `global` keyword are in the global scope. These variables are accessible throughout the module in all functions unless shadowed by a local variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Built-in Scope**: This scope contains names that are pre-defined in Python. These include functions like `print()`, `id()`, and data types like `int`, `float`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Demonstrating Different Scopes\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = \"global\" # Global scope\n",
    "\n",
    "def outer_function():\n",
    "    x = \"outer local\" # Enclosing scope\n",
    "\n",
    "    def inner_function():\n",
    "        x = \"inner local\" # Local scope\n",
    "        print(\"Inner function:\", x)\n",
    "\n",
    "    inner_function()\n",
    "    print(\"Outer function:\", x)\n",
    "\n",
    "outer_function()\n",
    "print(\"Global:\", x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code:\n",
    "- `x` in `inner_function` is local to `inner_function`.\n",
    "- `x` in `outer_function` is local to `outer_function` but can be accessed by `inner_function` if `inner_function` doesn't define its own `x`.\n",
    "- The `x` outside of all functions is in the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "When `inner_function` is called, it prints the value of `x` in its local scope. When `outer_function` is called, it calls `inner_function` and then prints the value of `x` in its local scope. Finally, the print statement outside any function prints the value of `x` in the global scope."
