    "# 15_Static Class Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are two main types of contexts within a class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Static Class Context**: This is the context in which class-level attributes (also known as class variables) and static methods are defined. These attributes and methods are associated with the class itself rather than any particular instance of the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Static Methods**: These are methods that don't require an instance of the class to be called. They do not receive an implicit first argument (like `self` for instance methods or `cls` for class methods). Static methods are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.\n",
    "   - **Class Variables**: These are variables that are shared across all instances of the class. They are not unique to each instance. Instead, if you change a class variable, it affects all instances of the class.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Instance Context**: This is the context in which instance attributes (unique to each instance of the class) and regular methods (which operate on an instance of the class) are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example to illustrate the static class context in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    class_variable = 10  # A class variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def static_method():\n",
    "        return 'Hello from a static method'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing class variable and static method without creating an instance\n",
    "print(MyClass.class_variable)           # Output: 10\n",
    "print(MyClass.static_method())          # Output: 'Hello from a static method'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Changing the class variable affects all instances\n",
    "MyClass.class_variable = 20\n",
    "print(MyClass.class_variable)           # Output: 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `class_variable` and `static_method` are defined in the static class context. They belong to the class `MyClass` itself and can be accessed directly using the class name."

    "A real-world case where `@classmethod` is particularly useful is in creating factory methods. Factory methods are those that instantiate objects from a class in various ways. This concept is especially handy when you have a class that can be initialized in more than one way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: User Account Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where you're building a system to manage user accounts in an application. A user account can be created in multiple ways: using an email address and password, using a social media account, or even from a guest account that converts to a regular account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you might use `@classmethod` for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class User:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, email, password):\n",
    "        self.email = email\n",
    "        self.password = password\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def from_social_media(cls, social_media_account):\n",
    "        email = social_media_account.email\n",
    "        password = social_media_account.generate_random_password()\n",
    "        return cls(email, password)\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def from_guest(cls, guest_account):\n",
    "        email = guest_account.email\n",
    "        password = guest_account.create_password()\n",
    "        return cls(email, password)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have a `User` class with:\n",
    "- The regular `__init__` method for creating a user with an email and password.\n",
    "- A `from_social_media` class method for creating a user from a social media account.\n",
    "- A `from_guest` class method for converting a guest account into a regular user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating a regular user:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   user1 = User(\"john@example.com\", \"johns_password\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating a user from a social media account:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   social_media_account = get_social_media_account()  # Assume this returns a social media account object\n",
    "   user2 = User.from_social_media(social_media_account)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Converting a guest account into a regular user:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   guest_account = get_guest_account()  # Assume this returns a guest account object\n",
    "   user3 = User.from_guest(guest_account)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these cases, the `User` class can be initialized in different ways, depending on the context. This makes the code more flexible and easier to manage. The `@classmethod` is crucial here because it allows these additional initialization methods to be part of the `User` class's definition, ensuring that all user creation logic is encapsulated within the `User` class."
