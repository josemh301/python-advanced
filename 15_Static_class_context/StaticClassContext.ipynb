    "# 15_Static Class Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are two main types of contexts within a class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Static Class Context**: This is the context in which class-level attributes (also known as class variables) and static methods are defined. These attributes and methods are associated with the class itself rather than any particular instance of the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Static Methods**: These are methods that don't require an instance of the class to be called. They do not receive an implicit first argument (like `self` for instance methods or `cls` for class methods). Static methods are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.\n",
    "   - **Class Variables**: These are variables that are shared across all instances of the class. They are not unique to each instance. Instead, if you change a class variable, it affects all instances of the class.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Instance Context**: This is the context in which instance attributes (unique to each instance of the class) and regular methods (which operate on an instance of the class) are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example to illustrate the static class context in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    class_variable = 10  # A class variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def static_method():\n",
    "        return 'Hello from a static method'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing class variable and static method without creating an instance\n",
    "print(MyClass.class_variable)           # Output: 10\n",
    "print(MyClass.static_method())          # Output: 'Hello from a static method'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Changing the class variable affects all instances\n",
    "MyClass.class_variable = 20\n",
    "print(MyClass.class_variable)           # Output: 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `class_variable` and `static_method` are defined in the static class context. They belong to the class `MyClass` itself and can be accessed directly using the class name."
