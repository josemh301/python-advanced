    "# 46_01 Closure\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a closure is a programming concept where a nested function remembers the environment in which it was created. This concept is crucial in functional programming and helps provide a way to maintain state in an immutable environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key points about closures in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nested Function**: A closure occurs when you have a function nested inside another function, and the inner function references variables from the scope of the outer function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lexical Scope**: The nested function (closure) remembers the variables from its enclosing scope even after the outer functionâ€™s execution is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **State Preservation**: Closures are often used to preserve a state, allowing nested functions to access variables that were created in their enclosing scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Encapsulation**: Closures provide a form of encapsulation, hiding variables in a private scope and preventing them from being modified directly from outside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of a Closure in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def outer_function(msg):\n",
    "    message = msg\n",
    "\n",
    "    def inner_function():\n",
    "        print(message)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return inner_function\n",
    "\n",
    "my_closure = outer_function(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "my_closure()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `outer_function` is the outer function.\n",
    "- `inner_function` is the nested function (closure).\n",
    "- `message` is a variable in the scope of `outer_function` that `inner_function` has access to.\n",
    "- When we call `my_closure()`, it executes `inner_function`, which remembers the value of `message` even after `outer_function` has finished executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closures are powerful and are used in various situations in Python programming, such as in decorators, functional programming, and event handling."
